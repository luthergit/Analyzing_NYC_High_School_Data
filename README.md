New York City has published data on student SAT scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets. I have combined the following data sets into a single, clean pandas dataframe:
SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
Class size - Information on class size for each school
AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
Demographics - Demographic information for each school
School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school
survey_all.txt - Data on surveys from all schools
survey_d75.txt - Data on surveys from New York City district 75
New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.
